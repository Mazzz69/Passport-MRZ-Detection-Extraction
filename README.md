# Passport MRZ Detection & Extraction

A computer vision pipeline that detects the **Machine Readable Zone (MRZ)** in passport images and highlights it with a bounding box. The system uses image processing techniques—grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, morphological operations, and contour analysis—to reliably locate the MRZ region, preparing it for downstream OCR and verification.
